# plant-Leaf-Disease-detection
The main aim of this project is to identify the diseases a plant leaf is suffering from so that we can give clear instruction to the farmer about the disease and the measures to be taken using CNN thereby reducing the economical losses. The Plant diseases effect the growth of the crop and reduces the quality of production. Convolutional neural networks helps in identification of features from the input images without the intervention of humans. Convolutional neural networks contains different layers and in each layer there are different activation function called neurons and have an impact on input image at each layer for the feature identification and disease detection. Based on the disease certain prevention measures are insisted to the farmers. Neural networks are used because of their great impact in the image classification.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this is plantvillage datset and it consists of 15000 images of 15 different classes
# Building Neural Network
The entire procedure for building the neural network is listed in document clearly.
# Result Analysis
The name of the disease that the leaf is affected by and provide proper remedies and displays the how the disease  affects the crop and why the disease has occured.
# modules Used
# TKinter
To create the GUI for displaying the disese 
# shutil 
This module helps in automating process of copying,moving and removal of files and directories
# os     
dealing with directories...The OS module in Python provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality. The functions that the OS module provides allows you          to interface with the underlying operating system that Python is running on â€“ be that Windows, Mac or Linux
# PIL    
Python Imaging Library. Python Imaging Library (abbreviated as PIL) (in newer versions known as Pillow) is a free library for the Python programming language that adds            support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. It is available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.
# sys    
The sys module provides information about constants, functions and methods of the Python interpreter. dir(system) gives a summary of the available constants, functions            and methods. Another possibility is the help() function. Using help(sys) provides valuable detail information.
# cv2    
working with, mainly resizing, images (open source computer vision)
# numpy  
dealing with arrays operations...since images are stored in a matrix form we should numpy to process the images
# tqdm   
a nice pretty percentage bar for tasks
# matplotlib 
for Plotting the graphs
# Tflearn  
TFlearn is a modular and transparent deep learning library built on top of Tensorflow. It was designed to provide a higher-level API to TensorFlow in order to                     facilitate and speed-up experimentations, while remaining fully transparent and compatible with it
