# plant-Leaf-Disease-detection
The main aim of this project is to identify the diseases a plant leaf is suffering from so that we can give clear instruction to the farmer about the disease and the measures to be taken using CNN thereby reducing the economical losses. The Plant diseases effect the growth of the crop and reduces the quality of production. Convolutional neural networks helps in identification of features from the input images without the intervention of humans. Convolutional neural networks contains different layers and in each layer there are different activation function called neurons and have an impact on input image at each layer for the feature identification and disease detection. Based on the disease certain prevention measures are insisted to the farmers. Neural networks are used because of their great impact in the image classification.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this is plantvillage datset and it consists of 15000 images of 15 different classes
# Building Neural Network
The entire procedure for building the neural network is listed in document clearly.
